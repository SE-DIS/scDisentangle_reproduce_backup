1) post_train:
    - Check criterions remained the same (same epoch) ***(Kang, Liver, Liver_hpi Norman, both)***
    - Check n_epochs = 520 (or 521)
    - Check that results match wandb results (by criterion)

2) No_leak:
    - For every dataset:
        Load model like in inference
        Check the mean is free from OOD leak

    - Criterions free from leak (normalization, DEGs)

3) scDisentangle inner working:
    - Read methods
    - Make simulated data
    - Set weights of all models to 1 or 0.5 or sth
    - Run a forward and a counterfactual:
        Do we get exactly the output in methods?

4) Reproduce one experiment in every dataset

5) Same cell type have same size and norman have same size
6) Same number of cells in all models
